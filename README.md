A repository to document my Python learning journey

# About me 
  I'm 21. I have lived in the bay area my whole life. I have one dog, named Ernie. This is my 4th year at West valley i currently am finding a major that suits me better then Early Childhood Education. I currently work at an elementary school in the afternoons.  

# Goals 
  My goal is to have fun and try to learn the basics of python. Another goal is to see if I have a unlearned passion for coding.
